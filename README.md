# Windows-API-C
Windows API stuff I've written in C/C++

Simple System Information - A little program I wrote that just displays some information;
                                                                                  Operating System version,
                                                                                  Computer name,
                                                                                  Number of logical processors,
                                                                                  Page file size,
                                                                                  Processor mask,
                                                                                  Minimum process address,
                                                                                  maximum process address
